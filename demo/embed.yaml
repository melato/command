short: demonstrate how to set command usage from an embedded Yaml file
long: |
  embed.go has a hierarchy of commands, whose usage is specified from
  the file embed.yaml which is embedded into the compiled executable.
  
  It also checks at the environment variable "USAGE_FILE". 
  If this variable contains the path of an existing file,
  embed reads usage data from that file, instead of the embedded file.
  This way you can refine the command usage by editing the usage file
  and rerunning the program without recompiling it.
    
  The commands in this demo do nothing, except for the "extract" command.

  embed.go requires Go 1.6.
commands:
  a:
    short: command a
  b:
    short: sub-commands b
    commands:
      b1:
        short: command b1
        long: |
          example sub-command b1
          with two lines of usage description
      b2:
        short: command b2
      b3:
        short: command b3
  c:
    short: command c  
  extract:
    short: extract command usage from the command hierarchy to Yaml
    long: |
      extract demostrates how you can convert the hardcoded usage from a
      command hierarchy and represent it in a Yaml file.
      
      You can then embed this yaml file in the program
      and remove hardcoded usage strings.
