short: demonstrate how to set command usage from an embedded file
long: |
  embed.go has a hierarchy of commands, whose usage is specified from
  the file embed.yaml which is embedded into the compiled executable.
  
  It also checks at the environment variable "USAGE_FILE". 
  If this variable contains the path of an existing file,
  embed reads usage data from that file, instead of the embedded file.
  This way you can refine the command usage
  by rerunning the program without recompiling it.
    
  embed requires Go 1.6.
